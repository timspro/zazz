Installation:

Install apache, mysql, and php. There are other guides on the internet that cover this so I won't go into
that here. On Ubuntu, it is as simple as: sudo apt-get install tasksel; sudo tasksel install lamp-server
The rest of this guide assumes you have installed these successfully.

Configure your apache so that "zazz" is the root, and enable .htaccess. Note that you could simply move the
contents of the zazz directory up to "www", but this is not advised since Zazz has functionality that 
allows it to delete everything in the "zazz" folder except a few files and the subfolder "zazz", so 
moving the contents up one directory makes it possible that Zazz may delete everything in your "www" folder.

This means that your config file (Debian: /etc/apache2/sites-available/default) should look like this:
DocumentRoot /var/www/zazz
        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
        </Directory>
        <Directory /var/www/zazz/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>
with /var/www changed to /var/www/zazz, /var/www/ changed to /var/www/zazz/, the second AllowOverride None
changed to AllowOverride All

And you will need to run:
sudo a2enmod rewrite
service apache2 restart

Examine the first five lines of zazz/includes/configure.php. You should see:
$deployPassword = '';
$globalPassword = '';
$databasePassword = '';
$deletePassword = '';

If you are installing Zazz on localhost, the only one you really need to set is databasePassword, and
that is only if you have a database password for the root database user.

The deployPassword is entered when the current project is written to the root URL. Ignoreable if your the only user.
The globalPassword is entered when creating new users.
The databasePassword is the password for the root user.
The deletePassword is entered when you want to erase all user-generated information in the database and files.
Note that this is only possible by visiting configure.php?delete=true when configure.php is in the zazz directory.

Move zazz/includes/configure.php to zazz/configure.php and visit the corresponding URL in a
web browser (for locahost on default port, it would be http://localhost/zazz/configure.php).

Read the output. It will tell you if something went wrong. Otherwise, proceed to zazz/login.php.
